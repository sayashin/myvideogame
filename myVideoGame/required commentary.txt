Hi, my name is Federico Sulimovich
Student Number: 220195973

My extensions:
1- Sound effects:
Add sound effects for every time you hit a collectible, every time you fall into the canyon, every time you collide with an enemy, and for background music as well.
2- Platforms:
I use the factory pattern function to create platforms where the character can stand and jump from.
3-  Enemies:
I use constructor functions to create a particle system that simulates a flame of fire that moves over the terrain and kills the character when it touches it.
4- Cloud movement:
Add a slight movement to the clouds that returns when they reach a certain point.
5- Character walking simulation:
I use two alternate drawings of the character to simulate the movement of the legs.

Most difficult thing:
What cost me the most was making my particle system move from left to right, but after a day of staring at the screen and trying everywhere, I discovered that it was not that difficult and I do not understand why I got stuck all day on that. 
Another tricky thing was to choose where to play and stop the sounds.

Skills:
I learned more than anything to use functions and to know where to call them, and when to use parameters and when not. The particle system is especially complicated because it calls functions within other functions and in different places in the code. And I learned to load sounds too.


Thank you very much to all of you, it was very fun learn to code with you guys.
